      <p> So many great things, expected of me, but what do I see, when I take a glance, in the mirror you ask? Hopeless potential, contradicting I know. But as I go through the journey of this life I aspire to lead, I recognize all the mess I expected me to be. Whether in my career or in my friends. I feel alone, and constantly afraid of the unknown. I would like to have success, but what does that really mean? They have the materials I’d like to obtain, a well-known name, of course the fame. So that's success, well I guess.
                        But my reality is I’ll probably never be like those I see, but do I even wanna be? Gotta recap, let's think.
                        Happiness, the real success, that's what I had to discover.
                        For me to get those degrees; marriage, become a father to be, etc. So what does it mean, for me to succeed? Don't know if I've got it all figured. I honestly doubt it, but I know now that simplicity is what I seek. For me to be "me" to live life happily.
                        So will I ever be rich? Probably not, but who knows. Let's see how it goes, but until then my expectations will be my own set goals instead of those expected of me on the outside looking in.    </p>
