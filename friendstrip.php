    Three best friends were planning for a short trip since so long. Three days before the planned day, they sat around making plans for the upcoming day. They were joyous, all three agreed to go three days after. It was fixed. One was even thinking that I will be going to be a trip of their life though it was a short trip. While other was thinking that he would turn the short trip to a long one by surprisingly pushing the other two friends to go even further beyond the pan. While the third one was thinking that he won’t spent a penny in this trip and enjoy being parasite to the other two friends. Each had something interesting in their mind until the trip day came.  <br> <br>
Three days were spent like a three minutes and it was a day of their trip. First friend message to the group chat saying let’s meet fast so that we won’t be late for the trip. The second friend replied he is sick and won’t be moving a step from his house or else his mom will hit him to death. The third one got pretty angry and decided to leave him and only two of them to be in the trip, and planned to meet the first friend twenty minutes after. <br> <br>
Twenty minutes passed like two minutes and that third friend was waiting for the first one in the middle of the road. He spent two hours waiting for him and then furiously called first one. After what first friend said the friend in the road fainted immediately. The first friend said he fell down miserably while leaving the house for the trip and now he is hospitalized. <br> <br>
Three hours after that incident in the room number three of the hospital, three friends were admitted. One broke his leg, other was sick and the third one is in coma. They successfully made their trip but the destination is only different and which they had never thought about. <br> <br>
