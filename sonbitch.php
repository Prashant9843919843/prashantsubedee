     <br>
      <p>  Abby a talented guy of around fifteen is the son of Lita. His friends call him a son of a bitch. That’s not something casual, they mean it. 
                        He was a son of a bitch. He never knew who his true father was and he never knew how his mother earns money. He was so fed up that everybody 
                        calls him a son of a bitch. He went home angrily and asked his mother about all these mess. Lita didn’t utter a single word, she was divested 
                        and broken when her son asked her the series of question. <br> <br>
                        Who is my father? What do you do to earn money? Why your work is always night shift? Lita had answers but she was scared to answer her son. 
                                              Then Abby decides to leave his mom and shift to a new city where no one knows him and he could start a new life. 
                                              Lita tried to stop her son, but Abby didn’t stop. 
                        Five years later, Abby felt so single and fed up with his new life and missed his mom. So, he decided to return back to his hometown. 
                     <br>  <br> But he didn’t find his mom in the home. A neighbour told him that she sold that house and   shifted to a new home but the neighbour 
                       didn’t know where. At first he was angry and frustrated but later he realized this is his fault too. As he shouldn’t had left the house in 
                       the first place.  So, he settles in the town. After a week he met his old friends. Friends then decides to have fun. Then Abby and his friends 
                       went to a prostitution home. <br> <br>
                         I don’t know how you react about this coincidence. After paying for a prostitute in the counter, Abby check-ins to the room and guess what? 
                         The prostitute was his mother. It was one hell of a moment for both of them. Abby in shock asked her again the same question which he asked 
                         before. Lita still didn’t want to answer but Abby insists if you don’t answer now you will never see me again.
                        So, finally Lita decided to answer all of his questions. <br> <br>
                        In a firm voice Lita started, “My father was a millionaire. I spent my childhood very well. I had everything that I wanted. 
                        My parents treated me like a princess. We had such a happy family. But a storm destroyed everything.” 
                          Lita started to cry, but Abby hold her hands and expected to hear more.
                          <br> <br>   
                        With a sad voice she resumed, “After my thirteen birthday, your grandfather’s company was in a heavy loss, 
                        he was broke within a few days of time and there was nothing that he could do about. We shifted in a small house from our mansion. 
                        After few days my father hanged himself till he died and my mum couldn’t handle what she saw and she died of heart attack right then. 
                        I became a homeless orphan then as our new landlord kicked me out after my parent death. I had a serious blow within a week and I was shocked.
                         I started walking in the road by begging to the people who passes by. I spent over a month like that. <br> <br>
                       One day a man came and take me to a restaurant nearby. I ate some quality foods there after a long time. Then he asked me if 
                       I wanted to eat more foods like that daily. I was happy and then I agreed to go with him. He then introduced me to Maya.
                        She was the owner of this prostitution home. A week was well spent but a day came where they made me a whore. 
                        My first night as a prostitute. I now wish I shouldn’t had done that. But that was written in my fate so, who could change that anyways. 
                        When the customer came near me he complemented me that I was beautiful and asked me to….. ”
                    <br>  <br>  Lita burst into tears. By then Abby also became calm and started to console his mum but he didn’t utter a single word. 
                        Lita started again, “After that day my life was never the same again. 
                        I was like a toy for many grown up men. I started earning for my own food and clothes. 
                        In sort I was a well settled business girl inside this house before I was even eighteen. I was seventeen when I got pregnant. 
                        Even I don’t know who your biological father is. Maya forced me to abort you, but I wanted to have you. You were the first born kid 
                        in this whore house. Everyone in the home was happy as you were born. Maya thought at least you can have a better life so with some funding 
                        she asked me to leave that house and start a new life with you. I then raised you far from that whore house. It was difficult for me to raise 
                        you as you started to grow up. So, I decided to go back. That’s why I had night shift. I did that all for you. ”
                                                Both cried and then Abby decides to take her away from that home. Abby apologized with his mom for being rude earlier 
                                                and thanks his mum for everything she had done for him. Then Abby and his mother started to live together happily ever after.
