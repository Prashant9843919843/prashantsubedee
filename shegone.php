      I can’t believe. I have nothing to say, it’s really disappointing after all those efforts 
      I had put on to carry on our relationship. She used to say she will never leave me but now she left me as if I am not a 
      human, I am a trash. It’s not her fault alone, I have also made many mistakes. My first mistake was I loved her selflessly 
      and it remained my only mistakes for my pain and suffer. Yes, I am suffering alone, sometime I had thought that there will 
      be someone who will by my side in all my sufferings and console me. But here I am, all alone in my pain and sufferings waiting 
      for someone to come and fix my broken heart which is very unlikely to happen. <br> <br>
She is now gone. She is now in the memories, those sweet memories. Thought I would one day say to her that,” What would I say to my heart one day if I couldn’t find you?” <br>
 Now I am saying that you won’t ever come, but your memories wouldn’t fade away from my mind.  <br>
Now I am saying that as you are not with me, you probably aren’t remembering me it’s only me stupid me remembering you, remembering the moments we shared. Trying to convince my heart that you are long gone but this stupid heart isn’t accepting that fact because your space is still occupied in it. <br>
Our relation was old like a tree in the park but guess what that tree had now been cut down and so is our relationship. 
I wouldn’t say coincidence because both were preplanned. She wanted to leave me earlier but how stupid of me I never realized 
that before until she left me. She left me alone in the world, took away my reason to be alive. I had her in my heart, and now 
it’s vacant, I feel nothing now. It pounds unnaturally, it’s no more fun to live. So, here I am in agony waiting for death to 
take over me.
