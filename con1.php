      It's been a while since I last saw her. She is my college senior and I am deeply in love with her but as she is my college senior I am scared to confront her and tell what I fell for her. I have sent her a request in Facebook but she hasn’t accepted that yet and I am in a fear that what if she will reject me in real life to like the same way she rejected me in Facebook. <br> <br>

Well, my story is more than that. Let’s start from the beginning. My first year of college, I saw her in my very first day. I walked out from home to college hoping that I would make good friends, but in the college I ended up falling in love, in love with my college senior. Our society generally tags “sister” if someone is older than you but I hated that. I wanted to love her not as a sister, definitely as my partner. But the question is will she accept my love? Will she accept me despite being younger than her? <br> <br>

There’s a saying that “Age doesn’t matter in love”. I must say that’s just bullshit, it sounds good only while saying in reality, age do matter. And if you love older girls then age definitely do matters. And in my case I think it matters because I don’t know about age but in terms of level, she is in final year (4th year) of college and I have just started. After COVID outbreak I haven’t seen her much and I badly miss her. <br> <br>
College will resume shortly and I am in a dilemma that whether I should confront her or not. I don’t know what to do. Some part of my heart says to confront her while some part is scared about the rejection and social values part. <br> <br>
I am in real trouble all thanks to LOVE.
