    <a href="dark.php" class="text-black"><p> She would braid my hair and recount harrowing 
                        tales, of my father and of demons from the underworld. 
                        She said, “All is forgiven but nothing is forgotten.” The darkness in her eyes was 
                        greater than usual. And her words flowed like waves.
                        She said all was well now the way it was........... <br> <br>

    <a href="expectations.php" class="text-black"><p> So many great things, expected of me, but what do I see,
     when I take a glance, in the mirror you ask? Hopeless potential, contradicting I know.
     I feel alone, and constantly afraid of the unknown. I would like to have success, but what does that really mean? 
     They have the materials I’d like to obtain, a well-known name, of course the fame. So that's success, well I guess.... <br> <br>

take over me.

      You could surround yourself with all that money can buy, and you’d still be as miserable as 
        a human can be. When you look for happiness in mere objects, they are never enough. 
        Look around, look within... <br> <br>
