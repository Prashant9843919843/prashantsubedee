      She opened her eyes to have a sight of dark sky and stars all over it. As she sat near her window
 a cold breeze blew displacing her hair and kepping her cool and feeling of aliveness. It seemed divine and magical like a dream. As she got up from the window she got up surrounded by darkness, she couldn’t move her hands neither her legs. She was paralyzed and couldn’t open her eyes too. <br> <br>

Few minutes later she opened her eyes and she felt like she is in another world, beautiful sunshine, cherry blossoms flying all over and no trace of human being at all. She feared more despite of the beauty around, she ran here and there in panic. She would walk few steps in panic and stop to look around in confusion. She tried to scream and shout but she wasn’t able to spell a single word, she panicked even more. She travelled around for hours helplessly and the day was about to end. <br> <br>

The dark night had risen and her fear had risen even more with hearts pounding faster than the legs of a horse, feet and hands trembling. She took some steps with her trembling pair of feet and she fell into a deep hole. After she fell sown, she couldn’t feel her body and she could barely move, she could only hear a voice, “hey, it’s late” in the distant.  She tried to open her eyes and hoped she would be out of the place, a place like home. But she was unable to open her eyes again. <br> <br>

Previous sound had faded away and she could now hear “tick-tock tick-tock.” She could think nothing, she was blank. With the pain and trouble in moving her hands and feet she cried but the tears had already dried and vanished once they got out of the eyes. She couldn’t even feel her own tears moving through her cheeks.  <br> <br>

Suddenly after a minute she felt a cold hand in her back and it strike her very hard. Her eyes open wide, she stood up in confusion. She had her sight all around and got to realize it’s her own room. She felt stupid remembering about the earlier events, she smiled and moved on to continue her day. <br> <br>
