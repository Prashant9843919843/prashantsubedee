      I am a married woman since past 5 years. My husband is a Computer Engineer. I love him and we had a love marriage.  Our relationship is very good and we both are totally satisfied with this marriage. But since he started to go out abroad every month with his work, I feel like he is cheating on me and things has never been the same afterwards. He barely picks up my phone when he is out abroad. After the work trip he always brings me some expensive gifts but I doubt that’s just to show that he is innocent. I don’t have any evidence and that maybe just my hypothetical theory but I don’t trust him like I used to before. <br> <br>
After many sleepless nights without him I decided to follow him in his next business trip. I called up my male best friend to accompany me and he agreed. So we both decided to follow my husband to his next trip and we did actually. Scenes abroad was something I didn’t wanted to see because my husband was actually working hard and he wasn’t cheating on me. We followed him for five days, so was his business trips time span and in that time he was busy he wasn’t cheating on me with other woman like I expected. <br> <br>
But in that trip something terrible happened, I fall in love with me befriend, I don’t know in anger with my husband or it’s just love but we had love and physical relationships too. I had that relationship with my best friend just two days after our trip. And after the fifth day till now I am so much in guilt. I was the one who cheated on my husband. My husband still doesn’t know about that incident and he still loves me like he used to do. But the question is, am I doing the same? I am a cheater and this fact is leading me to depression. I want to tell my husband about everything, me following him to the trip and my pre-marital affair. And I am scared to tell him. I fear he will leave me after knowing that. What to do now? God help me. I don’t know how will I cover up my mistakes. <br> <br>
