      There’s nothing to say like it’s beautiful in specific because everything is beautiful. <br>
Everything around us is beautiful, I am not saying you need a beautiful eye to see it because every eye is beautiful in it's own way
, you just need a beautiful mind to see it. Even a pile of garbage is beautiful. You might be thinking how can a pile of garbage can be beautiful; it’s just disgusting right? Well, the pile of garbage cen be disgustingly beautiful too, can’t it? <br>
You see nothing is perfect yet everything is perfect. Look at the beautiful full moon, it’s beautiful isn’t it but have you noticed some irregularities in its surface. Well-being so much beautiful, it still has some drawback. <br>
You might find the garden full of flowers very beautiful and fascinated by its beauty. Well hold on a second, you forget the dirt and muddy ground do you think that mud is beautiful or do you think the roots of the beautiful flowers are beautiful? Okay, I will leave that on you to decide. <br>
Somebody said, “beauty lies in the eyes of beholders.” Well that’s definitely wise and it’s a beautiful thought isn’t it.
